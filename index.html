        <h1>Plug In Baby</h1>
        <h3>By Muse</h3>
        <p>I've exposed your lies, baby<br>
            The underneath's no big surprise<br>
            Now it's time for changing<br>
            And cleansing everything<br>
            To forget your love</p>
        <p>My plug in baby
            Crucifies my enemies<br>
            When I'm tired of giving<br>
            My plug in baby<br>
            In unbroken virgin realities<br>
            Is tired of living</p>
        <p>Don't confuse<br>
            Baby you're gonna lose<br>
            Your own game<br>
            Change me<br>
            Replace the envying<br>
            To forget your love</p>
        <p>My plug in baby
            Crucifies my enemies<br>
            When I'm tired of giving<br>
            My plug in baby<br>
            In unbroken virgin realities<br>
            Is tired of living<br>
            And I've seen your loving<br>
            Mine is gone<br>
            And I've been in trouble</p>
    </body>
